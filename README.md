# Explore The World, Explore Yourself

## Abstract
This travel tracker app allows users to organize and review their past, current, and upcoming trips. By offering a clear overview of completed journeys, pending adventures, and future plans, the app streamlines travel management. With added features like user login and the ability to create new pending trips, tracking and planning travel experiences becomes an intuitive and user-friendly process.

## Context
I completed this project in week five of Mod 2 at the Front End development program at Turing School of Software & Design. I spent pproximately 35 hours on this project. 

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript written in the code editor VS Code with Webpack installed. GitHub was used to store and manage my code so though I completed all code on my local machine. For organization, I utilized a GitHub project board to keep track of issues.

I wrote the HTML with the smallest skeleton possible. CSS rules are written in order of the HTML skeleton. JavaScript functions were split into different files for easy readability. Testing was implemented with the Mocha framework and Chai library.

## Learning Goals
- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
- Understand the use of Webpack
- Implement fetch API callse to GET and POST
- Use Mocha framework with Chai library for TDD
- Create a project that is easily readable with separate files that store functions for DOM manipulation, data model, helper, api calls and scripts
- Create a login page for a user

## Future Features
- Travel agent login along with features for their use
- More information about their trips to be added
